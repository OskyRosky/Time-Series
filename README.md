# I. Time series

## 1. What's Time Series

### Definition

Time series refers to a sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive points in time. These data points are typically spaced at uniform intervals, such as hourly, daily, monthly, or yearly. The key characteristic of time series data is that it captures how a particular variable evolves over time, making it essential for understanding trends, patterns, and future projections.

### Applications

Time series data is used for analyzing information that changes over time: financial markets, weather patterns, economic indicators, industrial production, and many other domains.

### Historical Background

The need to collect and analyze historical data emerged with the advancement of record-keeping practices, particularly during the industrial revolution. Businesses, governments, and researchers started realizing the importance of tracking changes over time to make informed decisions and predictions.

### Differences from Traditional Statistical Analysis
